# Demystifying Email Address Regex

In the world of web development, validating user input is crucial, especially when it comes to email addresses. Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for performing such validations. This tutorial dissects and explains a regex pattern used to validate email addresses, demonstrating how it adheres to the common email address format.

## Summary

The regex we will delve into is crafted to recognize the typical format of an email address, consisting of a username, an `@` symbol, a domain name, and a top-level domain (TLD). Below is the regex pattern we will analyze:
```
/^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z]{2,6})$/
```
This tutorial will break down each component of the regex, providing you with a clear understanding of how it functions and how you can apply similar patterns for your validation needs.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are special tokens in a regex that match positions rather than actual characters.

- `^` asserts the position at the start of the string.
- `$` asserts the position at the end of the string.

These are essential in our email regex, ensuring the pattern matches from the start to the end of the string.

**Example:**
```
^user@domain.com$
```
### Quantifiers

Quantifiers define how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present for a match to be found.

- `+` The plus symbol indicates that the preceding character or group must appear at least once.

This quantifier is used in our email regex to match a sequence of one or more permitted characters in the username part of the email.

**Example:**
```
username+
```
### Character Classes

Character classes match any one character from a defined set of characters.

- `\d` is a character class that matches any digit, and is equivalent to `[0-9]`.

Within our email regex, `\d` allows numeric characters within the domain name.

**Example:**
```
domain123
```
### Grouping and Capturing

Parentheses `()` are used in regex to group together a part of the pattern and capture the matching text.

- `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)` captures the username.
- `([\da-z\.-]+)` captures the domain name.
- `([a-z\.]{2,6})` captures the TLD.

Captured groups are important for extracting parts of the matched string.

**Example:**
```
(username)@(domain).(TLD)
```
### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions `[]` match any single character from the set of characters they enclose.

- `[a-z0-9_\.-]` includes lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and hyphens.

This expression defines the allowed characters for each part of the email address.

**Example:**
```
[user-name]
```
